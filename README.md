- Database:

  This is the structure of our database:
  //collections diagram here

  Create an ``.env`` file in this format:
  ``` 
  PORT=5000
  DEBUG=true
  API_URL=http://localhost:5000
  CORS_ORIGINS=http://localhost:8080
  APP_SECRET='secret key'
  MONGODB_URI="mongodb uri"

  ```
  - Replace "mongodb uri" with the uri to the database that you create on your account.
  - Place the ``.env`` file in the ``backend`` folder

  ##### Full database access: The contributing team will need to provide you with the uri
